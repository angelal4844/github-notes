### Git
Git is "version control." "Version control" helps control the different changes and edits you made in history.
For example: when we are working on the google docs, we made many changes and edits. 
In the google docs, "see version history" helps see the different changes and edit by using "name current history" to help create names for every changes and edits you made. It helps make it easier to find the different chnages and edits. 

### Github 
Github is a website that can help see the different changes and edits you made in history. In addition, Github is "collaboration" where everyone can work together on a repo.

### Repo 
Repo is a file that you can create website and write things in it. In addition, you can also create new files inside the repo.

### Commit
